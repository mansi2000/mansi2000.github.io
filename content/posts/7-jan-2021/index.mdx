Life moves so fast and I can't commit to anything, not even writing everyday, so had to club two days. 

1:00 - 6th January

I want to add an image on this website, but I don't know what, where. hehe I just uploaded them on yesterday's post. 

10:00 - 6th January

Had to wake up early for the Twitter placement test, waking up in winters is so hard. The test ended around 12:30. Did 1.2 questions out of 2, and that isn't enough to crack Twitter obviously.

23:00 - 6th January

I think I gave a lot of work to the Web Team, and I overestimated a lot of things. So I thought of doing a few things myself, for two reasons - 
 - Explaining small bugs is harder, than fixing them yourself. 
 - I'll get an idea of the code too.

12:00 - 7th January

Practiced the pitch, we added Competitive Analysis ( SWOT ) , PEST analysis and SMART goal setting in our pitch.

3:30 - 7th January

Just gave the Ideastorm pitch, what a terrible experience man. Will write all the details in the new article that I'm writing.


EOD check-not-list (the list of things I couldn't do)

- Leetcode questions
- This blog, writing this on 8th
