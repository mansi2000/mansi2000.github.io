14:00 

I start my day really late, like all the other things in life. But I guess journalling would make my life a bit more organised. Did leetcode problems and the daily challenge today, it was just a basic question of merging two sorted lists. I didn't know daily challenges could be so easy. 

15:00 

I really liked this UI and tried setting it up for myself today. But had my Financial Accounting Final so I had to keep it on hold. The exam went fine and setting this up was so easy as Paras helped me out. 

19:45 

Had an Interview ( for IGDTUW Women Entrepreneurs ) with Kashika from IIM, Ahemdabad. The interview was 75 mins long, she had so many questions about Raahee and its founding members and the journey.
