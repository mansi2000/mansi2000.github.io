I start my day really late, like all the other things in life. But I guess journalling would make my life a bit more organised. Did leetcode problems and the daily challenge today, it was just a basic question of merging two sorted lists. I didn't know daily challenges could be so easy. 

15:00 

I really liked this UI and tried setting it up for myself today. But had my Financial Accounting Final so I had to keep it on hold. The exam went fine and setting this up was so easy as Paras helped me out. 

19:45 

Had an Interview ( for IGDTUW Women Entrepreneurs ) with Kashika from IIM, Ahemdabad. The interview was 75 mins long, she had so many questions about Raahee and its founding members and the journey. 

22:00

While trying to deploy this website, a weird error popped up 

    error: cannot stat 'component---node-modules-lekoarts-gatsby-theme-minimal-blog-core-src-templates-homepage-query-tsx-5de8d5f72b5a960d2ca8.js.map': Filename too long


It was a windows error. Git has a limit of 4096 characters but it uses an older version of the Windows API and there's a limit of 260 characters for a filename. Please change the API, git devs.
well I just had to change the git config file

    git config --global core.longpaths true
