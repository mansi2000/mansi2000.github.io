Just changed the Banner and favicon for this website. I was trying to upload a gif instead of a png, but it didn't work well on discord or whatsapp. Ahh well I wasted my time but it was fun.  

I just recieved a mail, from Ideastorm organisers, announcing the judges and I am already excited for it. I'd get a chance to pitch in front of Kunal Behl, Co-founder of Snapdeal and Pankaj Chaddha, Co-founder of Zomato. Wish me luck for my pitch ( which is on 7th January. )

Had a business mentoring session with Prashant sir, it was insightful and a bit harsh. He just gave us the reality check about the current situtation. Emotional Health truely is stigmatized, long way to go man, a long way to go.
We really need an FAQ/suggestion bot on the website. There is just so many questions we need to answer. And we need testimonials on the website.
