Woke up on time today (really!), and I thought *"It's new year, let's build some habits."*. I went ahead and completed the blog on Arch installation. Feels like a milestone to be honest. I mean it's great to have someone who's constantly asking you to complete a task.

I also decided to go ahead and start this blog as my daily programming journal. I think only I can hold myself accountable.

Installed Go. Wow the internet seems to want me to work today. xD

Just completed the January Challenge [Day 1](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/579/week-1-january-1st-january-7th/3589/).
Althought the problem seemed a bit challenging, I used hash table to store the first element of each piece with the repective vector. When I encounter the first number of a piece in array, I fetch the array and compare till the piece finishes.

```cpp
bool canFormArray(vector<int>& arr, vector<vector<int>>& pieces) {
        unordered_map< int, vector<int> > umap;
        for(int i=0; i< pieces.size(); i++) {
            umap[pieces[i][0]] = pieces[i];
        }
        
        for(int i=0; i<arr.size();) {
            if (umap.find(arr[i]) == umap.end()) {   
                return false;
            } else {
                for(int j=0; j<umap[arr[i]].size(); j++) {
                    if(arr[i+j] == umap[arr[i]][j]) {
                        
                    } else {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
                i+=umap[arr[i]].size();
            }
        }
        
        
        return true;
    }
```
